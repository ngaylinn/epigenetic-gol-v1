 * Struct types for representing a program for interpreting genotypes.

 * This project evolves the design for a genetic algorithm to solve a given
 * fitness goal. For that to work, the program must evolve a genotype as well
 * as a program for interpreting a genotype into a phenotype. The structs below
 * describe just such a program. They get allocated as a single block of memory
 * with a fixed size. This makes it relatively easy to pass these objects from
 * Python to C++ and from CPU to GPU.
